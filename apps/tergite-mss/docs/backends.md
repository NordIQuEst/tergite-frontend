# Backends

This is documentation about how we manage the different backends that connect to MSS

## How to Add New BCC

- Start your [tergite-backend](https://github.com/tergite/tergite-backend) instance
- Copy the `mss-config.example.toml` to `mss-config.toml`.  
  Note: You could also create a new toml file based on `mss-config.example.toml`  
  and set the `MSS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable to point to that file.
- Add the new client:

```toml
[[backends]]
# this name of the backend computer that will be accessible from tergite.qiskit and from webGUI
name = "simulator-arusha"
# the URL where this backend is running
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8002"
```

```shell
cp mss-config.example.toml mss-config.toml
```

- Update the values in the `mss-config.toml` file. It should have comments describing what each value signifies.

- Start your MSS

```shell
./start_mss
```
